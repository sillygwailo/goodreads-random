<p>Have too many books on the go? If you're tracking what you're reading with Goodreads, this app will look at your "currently-reading" shelf and randomly choose one of them to read. Refresh <a href="/">the home page</a> to select another book.</p>

<p>If you want to take another look at a book you've already read, but you're not sure which one, choose the "read" shelf after logging in and the app will pick one for you.</p>

<p>Unsure which book on your "to-read" shelf to read next? Login and switch to that shelf and let fate decide!</p>
